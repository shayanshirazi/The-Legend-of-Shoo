## 📥 Installation & Troubleshooting

Because I am an indie developer and not an "official" publisher with purchased certificates from Microsoft or Apple, your operating system might flag the game as a "suspicious file." **This is a false alarm.**

Here is how to run the game on your machine:

### 🪟 Windows
1.  Download and run the `.exe` file.
2.  If you see a "Windows protected your PC" warning:
    * Click **More Info**.
    * Click **Run Anyway**.
3.  Enjoy!

### 🍎 macOS
1.  Open your **Terminal**.
2.  Run the command: `sudo spctl --master-disable` *(Note: This allows apps from anywhere to run)*.
3.  Go to **System Settings** > **Privacy & Security**.
4.  Under Security, select **"Anywhere"**.
5.  Open the downloaded file and play!

### 🐧 Linux
* No extra steps needed! Just run the game and enjoy. (Linux wins again!)
